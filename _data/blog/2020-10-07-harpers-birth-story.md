July 5th 2019, Friday night after a relaxing night in I was starting to get mild cramps and knew that this was the beginning of your arrival.  At 10.09 I had a bloody show and I was so excited that we were finally going to meet our little rainbow baby.  I thought I better get some sleep before things get super intense, but of course I was tossing and turning ALL night and managed to get ZERO shut eye.  

The cramps where mild to moderate but totally manageable.

Midwife (Shannon) came over at around 7am, as we were planning on a home birth. Dilation was very slow and not much progression.  We tried everything, shower, bath, walking stairs, different yoga ball positions.....you name it we tried it.  The position baby was in was causing me not to be able to dilate, Shannon even tried to manually stretch my woohoo but even that didn't seem to help.  We broke my waters at 4.15pm in hope that may speed things up and along but NOPE still no change in dilation!  I was in extreme pain but I thought I can get through and hope theres even a little bit of progression, but as the time went by and each time she would check there was nothing.

I was staying at around 7cm the entire day so at around 7:30pm we made the decision that we would have to go to hospital for some further assistance, plus the pain was getting unbearable, along with the exhaustion and lack of energy, labour had be going for 21.5 hours already.

Finally made it to hospital, Lynton was a gem and made it a fast and not too bumpy ride to Rocky View hospital, its about a 25 minute drive and thankfully not rush hour.  Once we arrived my mum rushed to find me wheel chair, while I was making my way to the entrance we had to stop a couple of times as i got through a contraction.....Its funny at the moment you don't care who's around and who can see or hear you, you are in your own little bubble just meditating through the pain.  

As soon as we got to the room I was given Oxytocin and and epidural and the pain vanished instantly!  I felt amazing and couldn't believe one i worked so fast and two that it worked so well.  Our hope that this would help dilation and also change her position.  With each contraction she was like right there, Lynton and Mum were able to see her hair, but the she would go back up.  

Now that I was pain free I was told to try and sleep as I needed energy for when it was time to push.  At 3.30am on Sunday morning I was finally 9cm!!! I could finally start to see an end in sight.  7am and I could start pushing!!!! with each contraction, they had to count me down so I knew when to push as I was still on pain relief.  Moving different positions every so often, however when I would move to all fours thats when she would move out of position and her heart rate would drop so laying on my back with my legs pushing on what looked like part of a playground was which seemed to be my go to position.  Pushing for 3 hours, I was mentally and physically exhausted....I knew we were going to meet her soon enough but I didn't know what our next steps would be.  I remember thinking, just please not a C-section.  

Shannon decided to get the obstetrician in to talk about about our next steps and options.  As well as I needed a top up as when she did the last internal exam I have never felt so much pain in my life!  So our options were suction or forceps.  I was really leaning towards suction, as it seemed not as invasive, and thankfully she agreed to try that first.  The rest of the team arrived and there was about 9 or 10 people in the room that made it seem like holy shit this is it.....she's is actually finally coming!  With my next contraction I guess they attached the vacuum to her little head, I pushed and popped out she came 36.5 hours later...pain, tears, needles and a battered woo hoo but when she was finally in my arms crying it was totally worth everything that I had experienced.  I now understood what people say about the love for your child, although I was exhausted my heart exploded
